# Agent Instructions for AUG-29-ACA

**Agent's Responsibility:**  
This document is the single source of truth for agent collaboration on this project. With every new feature, bug fix, or refactor, you **must** update this document to reflect the changes. Add new sections for new features and update existing sections if their logic changes. This ensures that all agents have the most current information.

## Project Overview

This file provides Jules, as the agent, with all relevant information about the project:  
Structure, functionality, target audience, technical details, previous development steps, and planned future enhancements.

### Project Name
**AUG-29-ACA**

### Main Goal of the Website
Sophisticated presentation of the company’s services

### Target Audience
Our clients are companies.  
We specifically aim to reach:
- HR managers, who will be significantly relieved by our service
- Managing directors, whose personnel workload will be reduced through our engagement, or who can refocus their staff on core business activities instead of managing occupational pension schemes
- Employers and companies looking for simple solutions for corporate health or accident insurance

### Core Message / Value Proposition
Simple, high-tech full-service for:
- Setup
- Ongoing administration
- Consulting
- Liability protection

Provided by a company that is legally authorized to take on these responsibilities.  
We are currently working intensively to further automate our processes to enable even simpler, faster, and more digital administration — with the goal of providing maximum relief.

## Tasks for Jules

1. Prepare the project and website for deployment on a web service host such as [Render.com](https://render.com)  
2. Clean up and optimize the structure for better maintainability and easier adjustments  
3. Do not alter or remove any content unless explicitly instructed to do so  
4. Ensure that all original functions and visual elements remain intact

## Frontend–Backend Communication

Set up the code so that the backend (the "engine") also serves the frontend (the visual part).  
Both should be hosted together on a single service capable of running Python applications (e.g., Render.com).  
No database connection is required.

## Technical Structure and File System

### Project Structure and Emergent Integration

The project was created using Emergent and follows a modular full-stack approach.  
Emergent integration is documented via the configuration file `emergent.yml` and the summary file `summary.txt`.  
The project was likely generated using templates or the command line (CLI), with Emergent assisting in component generation and structural setup.

### Directory Overview

#### emergent/
- `emergent.yml`: Project definition and configuration for Emergent
- `summary.txt`: Automatically generated summary of the project structure and features

#### frontend/
- Technologies: React, Tailwind CSS, CRACO
- Structure:
  - `public/`: Static assets such as logos, icons, and `index.html`
  - `src/`: Source code, tests, and configuration files (`components.json`, `craco.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `package.json`)
- Note: `components.json` contains an overview of the integrated UI components, some of which were generated by Emergent

#### backend/
- Technologies: Python, likely Flask or FastAPI
- Structure:
  - `server.py`: Main server logic
  - `requirements.txt`: Dependencies
  - `env/`: Environment variables and configuration

#### tests/
- Test coverage: Backend tests (`backend_test.py`, `contact_test.py`, `test_optimizations.py`) and supporting documentation (`employer_obligations_summary.md`, `website_overview.md`)
- Additional files: `.gitignore` and `README.md` for maintenance and version control

### Emergent Components Used

- UI components: Buttons, forms, layout elements (visible in `components.json`)
- Backend functions: Routing, potentially authentication
- Configuration modules: Automated setup files for frontend and backend integration

## Platform Integration

The website was created using natural language instructions provided by me.  
Occasionally, I uploaded images, HTML scripts, or SVG files.  
The creation process did not rely on traditional UI tools but was driven by text-based interaction with Emergent.

---

## Goal: Deployment on Render.com

The project is intended to be deployed on [Render.com](https://render.com) — without a database connection.  
Frontend and backend will be served together via a single Python-compatible service.

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
No additional features are currently planned beyond the existing functionality.

### Database, CRM, or API Integration
Not planned for now.  
If everything works as expected, no external integration will be necessary.

## Frontend Design System

A complete visual overhaul has been implemented. All frontend development **must** adhere to the new design system.

- **Primary Documentation**: Before making any UI changes, you **must** read the new design system documentation located in `README_DESIGN.md`.
- **Use Design Tokens**: All styling (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.) is controlled by design tokens (CSS variables). **Never use hardcoded style values** (e.g., `color: #ffffff`). Instead, use the appropriate Tailwind utility class (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-primary`) which are mapped to these tokens. The tokens are defined in `frontend/src/styles/tokens.css`.
- **Use the Style Guide**: A live, interactive style guide is available at the `/styleguide` route when running the application locally. Use it to see all available components and their correct usage.
- **Component-Based**: The UI is built from reusable components. When you need a common UI element like a button or a card, use the existing components from `frontend/src/components/ui/`.

Adhering to this system is critical for maintaining the visual consistency and maintainability of the application.
